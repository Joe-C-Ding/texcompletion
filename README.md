# texcompletion
Vim filetype plugin to complete TeX / LaTeX control sequences

## featrue
There are several plugins that help `Vimmer` to write Tex/LaTeX documents, such as
[Vim-Latex](https://github.com/vim-latex/vim-latex). Some of them are good but heavy,
every keystroke tends to be a mapping! Also you neet to spent time to learn
how to use those plugins.

`texcompletion` is light and simple, only one function is there, which help you to complete
the TeX/plain-Tex/LaTeX control sequences or commands, by typing `<C-X>u` or `<C-X><C-U>`
in insert-mode. 

This is something called `User defined completion`, and is a build-in feature of Vim. If you are
not familiar with that, see `:h ins-completion` for more infomation.
